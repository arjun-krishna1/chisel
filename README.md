- The AI 3D Computer Graphics Editor
- Built to make you extraordinarily productive
- Inspired by: https://x.com/fahdananta/status/1828454926218932558
- Here are the **three most useful features** for an AI assistant designed for 3D graphics editing in Blender that would provide a "WOW" experience:

## 1. AI-Powered 3D Modeling Commands
- **Description**: Users can input natural language commands to generate or modify 3D models. For example, saying "Create a futuristic chair" would result in the AI generating a model that fits that description.
- **Benefit**: This feature dramatically reduces the time and effort needed for modeling, making it accessible for beginners while enhancing productivity for experienced users.

## 2. Smart Material Creation
- **Description**: Users can describe materials in plain text (e.g., "Create a shiny, red metal material") and the AI generates appropriate shaders and textures automatically.
- **Benefit**: This simplifies the material creation process, allowing artists to focus on design rather than technical shader setup, and encourages creativity by removing technical barriers.

## 3. Intelligent Rigging Assistant
- **Description**: Automatically generates rigs for characters or objects based on their geometry and user specifications, such as "Rig this character for animation."
- **Benefit**: This feature saves significant time in the rigging process, which is often complex and tedious, enabling animators to get their characters ready for animation quickly and efficiently.

These features would not only enhance the user experience but also significantly streamline workflows in Blender, making the tool more powerful and user-friendly.
